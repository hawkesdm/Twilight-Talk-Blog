            <p>The very first episode of the Twilight Zone really sets the tone for what's to come. It would soon become the gateway to the <i>5th dimension</i> after it's first broadcast on October 2, 1959. Serling's short and sweet opening narration really sums up what this brilliant episode is about.</p>
            <hr style="width: 100%; color: black; height: 1px; background-color:white;" />

            <p>I dont't even know where to begin, this episode really highlights the raw imagination that is not far from truth behind Rod Serling. I will be going over the story and the reveal at the end as well so if you haven't seen this episode yet PLEASE go watch it before you read. Thank you.</p>
			<p> The episode starts out with a man in a jumpsuit walking towards a diner from a dirt road. The diner is playing the LOUDEST diner music iv'e ever heard and when the man walks inside he finds there is no one inside to listen to this incredibly loud music and to his surprise also doesn't know anything about his self or why he is wearing this Air Force jumpsuit.</p>
			
			<img src="img/where5.png" id="where5" class="img-thumbnail" width="500px" height="500px" >
			
            <p> After he realizes that there is no one there to serve him his "eggs over easy, hashbrowns and ham" he then mozys into the town down the street. He walks around for a little bit until spotting from afar what seems to be a woman sitting in the passenger seat of the car so he yells out to her and begins<img src="img/where4.jpg" id="where4" class="img-thumbnail" width="250px" height="230px" align="right"> walking towards her while explaining that he doesn't remember even waking up this morning and that he just remembers starting off on that dirt road.</p> <p>By this time he is actually leaning on the passenger side door which he then opens to touch the woman but her upper half then falls out of the car as it is just a manequin. I find this part kind of funny because he definitely gets close enough to realize it's a plastic mannequin but also because after she falls out of the car he still engages in conversation with her telling us that this guy desperately needs someone or anyone to talk to at this point.</p>
    
            <p>After some fumbling around at a pay phone he notices a police station in which he walks into it and finds a lit cigar and what looks to be like someone was just shaving their face because there is a fresh brush and razor. He then gets that eerie feeling that something is wrong and starts chanting that he needs to wake up now and as he chants, the gate to the cell he is in starts slowing closing on him and he then darts out of the police station with a final exclamation before they cut to commercial, "Where is everybody!?". </p>

			<img src="img/where3.png" id="where3" class="img-thumbnail" width="300px" height="300px" >
            
            <p>At this point he is now set on this whole reality being a dream of some sort and that he has grown tired of it and now wants to wake up as he says while he makes an ice cream sunday. Then comes a bit of irony in the episode when he turns a spinner full of books with ALL the books titled: "The Last Man On Earth".<img src="img/where2.jpg" id="where2" class="img-thumbnail" width="250px" height="230px" align="right"> After a little while it gets dark finally and our lonely man stumbles upon an ad for a movie with some airmen on it and remembers now that he is in fact in the air force.</p><p> He then runs around a theatre desperately screaming to anyone who will hear him that he is in the air force. After a series of stumbling around on the ground he looks up and sees a picture of an eye on the glass of an optomotrist's shop and that's when his mind cracks and starts feeling like someone is watching him so he runs to a street light and frantically presses the button over and over while crying for help looking quite pitiful and covered in sweat.</p>
            <hr style="width: 100%; color: black; height: 1px; background-color:white;" />

			
			<p>The episode then cuts to an army hangar where they reveal that this man was in a simulation of a trip to the moon for about 2 and a half weeks before he "cracked" with "delusions" of some kind. They grab the man out of the box and take all the wires off of him telling him that his mind created a delusion for him, that they can create everything for a human to live and be happy but they cannot simulate the basic need for companionship and that the next time he will be on the moon for real then the episode concludes with some gems from Rod Serling himself. </p>
			
			<img src="img/where6.jpg" id="where6" class="img-thumbnail" width="250px" height="230px" >
			
            <p>This episode is really trying to touch on the fact that all humans have a neccesity for human interaction of some sort. Isolation for anyone can definitely cause the mind to manifest anything whether it be good for the mind or bad. Deprivation of human interaction causes the mind to go to extreme measures as this did. This pilot received outstanding ratings with superb ratings from the <i>New York Times</i>.</p><p> I liked the first episode alot, I dont think it would make my top ten but definitely my top 20. When I first saw this episode I didnt expect that kind of twist at all and I felt like it truly means that we all really need each other whether we like it or not. This is also the first of many episodes to claim that someone is basically just having some delusions. Let me know what you all thought if the first episode of the Twilight Zone in the comments.
