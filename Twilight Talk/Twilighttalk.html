	<p>My name is Douglas Hawkes, the creator of <i>'Twilight Talk'</i>. I am 27 years old and grew up in and still live in Richmond, Virginia. I saw my first glimpse of this crazy tv series when I was probably around 13 or 14 and at first I was 
	extremely frightened because I had never seen anything like this before growing up.</p><br><p>I immediately took interest into this series because when I was that young I was into alot of scary tv shows and movies as well
	even though my parents were still monitoring what I was watching from time to time. When I discovered what this show actually was and what is was about, it became a must watch for every season and episode but that took a long time because at
	this time it was only coming on the scifi channel after 1 in the morning and they also would show a marathon on New Year's Eve so as you can imagine there were alot of gaps and I wasn't understanding the show as a whole.
	
	<p>I was then forced to try and watch these episodes online which they did have some full episodes for the most part but a number of episodes wouldn't even play which was really frustrating for me because at this point I was really into it and the morals behind each thrilling 
	episode. </p><p>Years went by and I moved on to new shows but then good old Netflix started streaming everything and one day I found what I was longing for in the past on Netflix, as you can guess it was 'The Twilight Zone' seasons 1,2,3, and 5. I was exstatic
	when I saw this and immediately dove in starting with season 1. I have seen every episode at least 10 times and they never get old so I figured there has to be individuals out there like me who greatly appreciate and enjoy this show just as much as me
	so I decided to create 'Twilight Talk' for everyone to come together and exchange ideas and share their love for this show.</p>
				
				<!--<p>The Twilight Zone was a television series created in 1959 by a man named Rod Serling. Rod Serling was an American
	screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his
	science-fiction anthology TV series, The Twilight Zone. Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and
	helped form television industry standards. He was known as the "angry young man" of Hollywood, clashing with television 
	executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war.</p>-->

							  <p class="card-text mb-auto ">The very first episode really sets the tone for what's to come. It would soon become the gateway to the <i>4th dimension</i>. <!-- When The Twilight Zone came out, it took anthology to a whole new level. It had a bit
					of psychological horror, fantasy, science fiction, suspense and psychological thriller with an unexpected twist and or moral 
					at the end of every episode. The original series ran from 1959 to 1964. It was a real popular success and introduced the age of science fiction along with fantasy as well.
					To this day I still watch all the seasons over and over again and I still get something meaningful out of them every time, whether
					it be a good moral or some kind of idea that the episode sparked in my head. I also feel like the black and white effect gives the
					show more of a nostalgic feeling and feeling of unknown as well.</p>-->

				  <div id="tabs-1">
					<p>The <i>Night Gallery</i> was also an American anthology series that aired on 
					NBC from 1969 to 1973, featuring stories of horror and macabre. Serling was the host 
					of the show and also contributed scripts but didn't have as mich control over the show 
					as he did the Twilight Zone. The show would start off with Serling appearing at an art 
					gallery setting introducing macabre tales. He had a usual intro and then would unveil 
					the painting and the episode would start from there. It regularly presented adaptaptations 
					of classic fantasy tales as well as original works, many of which were by Serling himself.</p> </div>
				  <div id="tabs-2">
					<p><i> Patterns</i>, was the first major breakthrough of Rod Serling when the live television 
					drama received critical acclaim. The  intense big-business drama starred Richard Kiley 
					as up-and-coming vice-president Fred Staples. Ruthless corporate boss Walter Ramsie attempts 
					to edge out aging employee Andy Sloane to make room for newcomer Staples. Ramsie uses every 
					opportunity to humiliate the fragile Sloane, while Staples sees Sloane as a professional who 
					makes valuable contributions to the firm. Serling's celebrated script tore apart the dynamics 
					of the business world and earned Serling his forst six Emmys for dramatic writing.</div>
				  <div id="tabs-3">
					<p><i>Seven Days in May</i> is a 1964 American political thriller motion picture about a 
					military-political cabal's planned takeover of the United States government in reaction to 
					the president's negotiation of a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. The screenplay was 
					written by Rod Serling based on the novel of the same name by Fletcher Knebel and Charles 
					W. Bailey II, published in September 1962.</p> </div>
